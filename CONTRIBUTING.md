Contributing
============

1. **Topic branch**. Work in a dedicated topic branch. Rebase against master
   before submitting your pull request if master has changed.

2. **Commit message format**. See [this][format] and use present tense (*Add
   feature*, not *Added feature*).

3. **Squash commits**. Squash related commits together. If there is no good
   reason to have separate commits for something, combine them.

4. **Passing tests**. Run `bundle exec rake`. This will run RuboCop and RSpec.

5. **Code coverage**. `bundle exec rake coverage` should report 100% coverage.

Thank you!
